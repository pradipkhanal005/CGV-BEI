# Computer Graphics Project Concept Note

## Project Title

Minecraft-Style Voxel World Game

## Selected Area / Tool

Simple 3D Game Development

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Python
* Ursina Game Engine
* Panda3D (rendering backend)
* NumPy (optional, for terrain generation)

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a basic Minecraft-like 3D voxel game using the Ursina game engine. The game will feature a block-based world where players can explore, place, and remove blocks in a first-person environment. The focus is on understanding 3D rendering, camera control, collision detection, and real-time interaction in a graphics engine.

## Final Expected Outcome

A playable 3D voxel game that includes:

* First-person player movement and camera control
* A procedurally or manually generated block world
* Block placement and destruction mechanics
* Basic textures for different block types
